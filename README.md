# About this repo

This repo contains several coding samples. Below is a summary of these scripts. 

## Python sample 

This folder contains multiple scripts for a project related to teaching evaluations, aiming to access course dilivery in terms of facial, verbal, and textual sentiment or emotions, among many other dimensions. The analysis used a mixture of API requesting, pre-trained models, as well as lexicon-based methods. 

*Note*: This project is still preliminary. 

## Stata sample

This code preprocesses CHNS CHNS data by UNC Chapel Hill and Chinese CDC and the Chinese national microsensus. It cleans the data, generate variables, and conduct regression analysis. It was written during the period when I was an RA of Professor David Ong. 

# Q&A

1. **Question**: What is your proficiency of each programming language?

   **Answer**: I am proficient in Python, R, and Stata. I have used MATLAB and Julia for several times, and my level is beyond introductory. I write MATLAB better than Julia. 

1. **Question**: What other languages, computer programs, or software, do you have experience in?

   **Answer**: Here is a complete list I can think of. 

   * Data analysis and computation: Stata, R, Julia, Tableau, MATALB, VBA, SQL, Minitab, SPSS, Mathematica
   * General purpose: Python, C
   * Optimization: LINGO, NetLogo, Gephi
   * Typesetting: HTML, LaTeX (including TikZ), Mermaid, Visio, Microsoft 365
   * Others: Adobe PS/AU/LR/PR/AE, ImageJ
   * R packages: `bayesplot`, `boot`, `BradleyTerry2`, `brms`, `BSBT`, `car`, `caret`, `causalTree`, `coda`, `data.table`, `dirichletprocess`, `dplyr`, `e1071`, `forecast`, `ggplot2`, `ggpubr`, `grf`, `haven`, `ISLR`, `ivreg`, `keras`, `lubridate`, `MASS`, `MatchIt`, `plm`, `prefmod`, `qvcalc`, `randomForest`, `readxl`, `rmarkdown`, `rstan`, `shiny`, `stringr`, `tidyr`, `tidyverse`, `xgboost`, `zoo`
   * Python packages: `arviz`, `beautifulsoup4`, `causalml`, `cmath`, `collections`, `csv`, `datetime`, `deep-sort-realtime`, `deepface`, `distance`, `dlib`, `econml`, `ensurepip`, `estimate`, `faker`, `glob`, `graphviz`, `itertools`, `json`, `jupyter`, `keras`, `loss`, `math`, `matplotlib`, `mlxtend`, `moviepy`, `multiprocessing`, `near`, `networkx`, `nltk`, `numpy`, `numpy_financial`, `openpyxl`, `operator`, `os`, `pandas`, `pickle`, `pillow`, `pyaudioanalysis`, `pyarrow`, `pycocotools`, `pydub`, `pymc`, `pytorch`, `random`, `requests`, `SALib`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `selenium`, `seaborn`, `speechbrain`, `stan`, `statsmodels`, `statistics`, `tensorflow`, `time`, `torchvision`, `torchaudio`, `transformers`, `ultralytics`, `whisper`, `xgboost`
   * APIs: Google speech-to-text, Face++, OpenPose, YOLO

1. **Question**: Why are the themes of the code so diverse?

   **Answer**: I have a BS degree in Applied Mathematics with Economics, and the program structure led to separated research and study in mathematics and economics. Fortunately, I am able to combine the very mathy part (involving Bayesian comparative judgment) with the very behavioral part by a recent ongoing project with Professor David Ong at the J-BJI. 

1. **Question**: Further information about me?

   **Answer**: 
   * For admission or hiring teams, I should have already submitted an application with my CV before you clicked into this repo! Plase refer to that or other materials that I submitted. If you need more, please don't hasitate to email me at [glenntfung@gmail.com](mailto:glenntfung@gmail.com)! 
   * For others, I am very open to adcademic/professional collaboration or communication, both within mathematics/statistics or social science/business research, and interdisciplinary research. Please feel free to email me at [glenntfung@gmail.com](mailto:glenntfung@gmail.com) with any inquiries or visit my [personal website](https://glenntfung.github.io) to know more about me.
