# About this repo

Welcome! This repository showcases several coding samples that reflect my skills and experience across various programming languages and research domains. Below is an overview of the scripts included:

## Python sample 

This folder contains scripts from a project related to teaching evaluations. The objective is to assess course delivery through facial, verbal, and textual sentiment or emotional analysis. The work combines API requests, pre-trained models, and lexicon-based methods.

> **Note**: This project is still preliminary. 

## R sample

This script includes code for a method that ranks the timing of trades. Specifically, it detects systematic earliness or lateness in persistent insider trading by ranking cumulative ratios (e.g., $CARR$). 

## Stata sample

This script was for rocessing CHNS data (from UNC Chapel Hill and the Chinese CDC) and the Chinese National Microsensus. The code focuses on data cleaning, variable generation, and regression analysis. This script was developed during my time as a research assistant for Professor David Ong. 

## Julia sample 

This script analyzes the distributions of individual ratings stored in JSONL files. It plots the distributions, computes the Wasserstein distance, and performs bootstrapping to generate confidence intervals for distributional differences.

# Q&A

1. **Question**: What is your proficiency of each programming language?

   **Answer**: I am highly proficient in Python, R, and Stata. Additionally, I have intermediate experience with MATLAB and Julia, with stronger fluency in MATLAB.

1. **Question**: What other languages, computer programs, or software, do you have experience in?

   **Answer**: Here is a comprehensive list:

   * Data analysis and computation: Stata, R, Julia, Tableau, MATALB, VBA, SQL, Minitab, SPSS, Mathematica
   * General purpose: Python, C
   * Optimization: LINGO, NetLogo, Gephi
   * Typesetting: HTML, LaTeX (including TikZ), Mermaid, Visio, Microsoft 365
   * Others: Adobe PS/AU/LR/PR/AE, ImageJ
   * R packages: `bayesplot`, `boot`, `brms`, `caret`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `grf`, `rstan`, `tidyverse`, `xgboost`, and many more.
   * Python packages: `arviz`, `econml`, `deepface`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `torch`, `transformers`, and many more.
   * APIs: Google speech-to-text, Face++, OpenPose, YOLO

1. **Question**: Why are the themes of the code so diverse?

   **Answer**: I have a BS degree in Applied Mathematics with Economics, and the program structure led to separated research and study in mathematics and economics. Fortunately, I am able to combine the very mathy part (involving Bayesian comparative judgment) with the very behavioral part by a recent ongoing project with Professor David Ong at the J-BJI. 

1. **Question**: Further information about me?

   **Answer**: 
   * For admission or hiring teams, I should have already submitted an application with my CV before you clicked into this repo! Plase refer to that or other materials that I submitted. If you need more, please don't hasitate to email me at [glenntfung@gmail.com](mailto:glenntfung@gmail.com)! 
   * For others, I am very open to adcademic/professional collaboration or communication, both within mathematics/statistics or social science/business research, and interdisciplinary research. Please feel free to email me at [glenntfung@gmail.com](mailto:glenntfung@gmail.com) with any inquiries or visit my [personal website](https://glenntfung.github.io) to know more about me.
